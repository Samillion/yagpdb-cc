# YAGPDB Custom Commands
A few custom commands I've made for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) Discord bot to use on my server. Some of them are useful, though probably they're not. Maybe a little. ðŸ˜†

It's mostly specific use case scenarios, random coding out of boredom or to do things within Discord instead of having to do it on a browser because I'm lazy.

## Commands
- [Dreams](./Dreams)
- [Fun Interactions](./Fun%20Interactions)
- [World Clock v2](./World%20Clock%20v2)
- [Random String](./Random%20String)
