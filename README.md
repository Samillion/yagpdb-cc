# YAGPDB Custom Commands
A few custom commands I've made for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) Discord bot to use on my server. Some of them are useful, though probably they're not. Maybe a little. ðŸ˜†

It's mostly specific use case scenarios, random coding out of boredom or to do things within Discord instead of having to do it on a browser because I'm lazy.
