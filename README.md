A few custom commands I've made for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) Discord bot to use on my server. Some of them are useful, though probably they're not. Maybe a little. :laughing:

It's mostly specific use case scenarios, random coding out of boredom or to do things within Discord instead of having to do it on a browser because I'm lazy.

## Custom Commands
- [Dreams](./Dreams)
  - A command to post messages in a dedicated dreams channel. The intended use is to post dreams you have when sleeping, though it can be used for dreams as in "hopes" as well.
- [Fancy Text](./Fancy%20Text)
  - A simple command to convert any text into 𝐹𝒶𝓃𝒸𝓎 𝓉𝑒𝓍𝓉 easily
- [Fun Interactions](./Fun%20Interactions)
  - As basic as it gets, and as seen on many bots. `-hug @user`, `-slap @user`, `-spank @user`, `-fart @user` will generate an embed with a humorous GIF from a list.
- [Random String](./Random%20String)
  - A random string generator with options to control the type and amount of characters in output.
- [Search Link](./Search%20Link)
  - A search link generator for Google, Duckduckgo, Brave and Wikipedia.
- [Server Info](./Server%20Info)
  - A simple command to view general information related to your Discord server.
- [User Info](./User%20Info)
  - A command to view general information about a user on your Discord server.
- [World Clock v2](./World%20Clock%20v2)
  - A command to view current time of a country, compare time between countries or view a specific time from different regions based on a country's specific time.
- [Skyforge MMO Info](https://github.com/Samillion/skyforge-yagpdb)
  - Custom commands that provide useful information about the MMO game [Skyforge](https://sf.my.games/en)
